	<h4>PhD positions in Deep Learning for Satellite Image Analysis</h4>
 	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-12">
			We are looking for highly motivated PhD candidates to join the <a href="https://www.rsim.tu-berlin.de/menue/remote_sensing_image_analysis_group/" target="_blank">Remote Sensing Image Analysis (RSiM)</a> group at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Technische Universit√§t Berlin, Germany. The research of the PhD candidates will aim at developing innovative machine learning techniques (with a special focus on deep learning) for the analysis of big data from space. The main topics include: 1) developing deep neural network models that can overcome the data imbalance problems for satellite image classification; and 2) developing active learning methods that are applicable to the designed deep neural networks. MSc degree is required in computer engineering or computer science with experience in computer vision, deep learning for image understanding. Very good command of German and English is required. For details, please visit this <a href="https://stellenticket.de/72624/?lang=en" target="_blank">link</a>.
