Ankara Hyperspectral Image Archive

Description:This is a small benchmark hyperspectral image archive that has been published for research purposes. 
The archive consists of 216 hyperspectral image tiles obtained by fragmenting a hyperspectral image acquired by EO-1 Hyperion sensor over surroundings of
Ankara, Turkey. Each image tile has been annotated with multiple land-cover class labels (see Table 1) and with a land-use category label (see Table 2). 
In order to annotate each patch with appropriate land-cover class labels, very high resolution (VHR) satellite images were used. 
To this end, fingerprint of each hyperspectral image patch has been projected on VHR images acquired on July 27, 2016. 
The error rate of the annotation process was minimized due to small difference between acquisition dates of the hyperspectral and VHR images. 
It is worth noting that land-cover classes associated to the similar type of materials (e.g., Crop Type-A, B and C) 
were identified by visual inspection by comparing the spectral signatures of homogenous regions.
